Regions.js
==========

The first implementation for the CSS3-Regions in the real world.

That means : not in an experimental browser made fast by Adobe.

What's the big deal ?
---------------------

If you find [this](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/cssregions/) interesting, just try this script !

It requires jQuery and Lettering.js in order to work, but after that, you just have to use CSS normally.

**Hum ! Sorry, for the moment we're unable to get it working automatically (yes, I lied before !). And in the case it's working, it may be really processor intensive ! So be careful with it !**

How it (should) work (in the future) !
--------------------------------------

Add that in your page : 

    <script src="jquery.js"></script>
    <script src="lettering.jquery.js"></script>
    <script src="regions.js"></script>

Follow the specs and you are good to run !

Oh ! And you should use Modernizr, a test for it is present somewhere in the repository !

Ok, this is really bad documentation, but for the moment, just the core component are working (and not so well !). My advice is : patience !
